# Toms-Shock-Velocities

Here is a dashboard to give you real time feedback on the shock velocities.  The colors will change based on the velocity of the shock travel and the colors are mapped the same as demonstrated in the Motec v7-6 workbook that is here on my github.  Watch the video referenced on the Motec workbook repository to understand how to read the colors.
